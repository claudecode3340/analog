# Analog Gym — content inventory

Built from everything in `source/`: the exported tutoring conversation, Razavi 2nd ed. (801 pp.), your handwritten lecture notes 1–12, the settling-time example, the current-mirror handout, Tutorials 1–6, the Quiz 1 and Quiz 2 keys, and the course handout.

Tags such as **[U4]** or **[L2]** give the curriculum unit each item belongs to (CLAUDE.md §7). "Conv" means the tutoring conversation.

## 1. Flags: where the sources disagree or are incomplete (please decide)

1. **Your lecture numbering is not the handout's numbering.** Your notes are numbered by class date and run ahead of the handout plan:

   | Your notes | Content | Handout lecture | 2nd ed § |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Lec 01 (3 Aug) | Gain, gain error, Ex 9.1 | L1 | 9.1.1 |
   | Lec 02 (5 Aug) | Performance parameters; 5-T OTA and fully differential one-stage: CMIR, swing, BW | L1–L2 | 9.1, 9.2.1 |
   | Settling example | Ex 9.2 by Laplace | L1 | 9.1.1 |
   | Lec 03 (7 Aug) | Unity-gain buffer (Ex 9.4), telescopic, mirror-loaded telescopic, buffer window | L2 | 9.2.1 |
   | Lec 04 (10 Aug) | Buffer window again; **design of telescopic (Ex 9.7)** | L3 | 9.2.2–9.2.3 |
   | Lec 06 (14 Aug) | Folded cascode CMIR (NMOS and PMOS input), shorted output, **gain boosting starts** | L4, L6 | 9.2.4–9.2.6, 9.4 |
   | Lec 07 (17 Aug) | **Two-stage op amp**, gain boosting derivation (Rout = RS + rO + (1+A1)gm RS rO) | L5, L6 | 9.3, 9.4 |
   | Lec 08 (19 Aug) | Gain boosting: Gm, Rout, (gm rO)³, circuit implementation (M3 auxiliary), Vout,min = VGS3 + Vov2 | L6 | 9.4 |
   | Lec 09 (21 Aug) | Aux amp as CS stage; differential gain boosting; folded-cascode aux; **CMFB intro** | L6, L7 | 9.4, 9.7.1 |
   | Lec 10 (24 Aug) | CMFB: concept, resistive sensing (R1 = R2), gain with R1, R2, source-follower sensing | L7 | 9.7.1–9.7.2 |
   | Lec 11 (31 Aug) | CMFB: triode sensing (Ron10 ‖ Ron11), differential-pair sensing, feedback loop | L7–L8 | 9.7.2–9.7.3 |
   | Lec 12 (2 Sep) | CMFB techniques: Vout1 + Vout2 equation, current-mirror implementations, error removal | L8 | 9.7.3 |

   **Proposal:** the app follows the handout's L1–L14 (the exams follow it) and shows "your notes: Lec 07" on each lesson. So **L5 two-stage, L6 gain boosting and L7–L8 CMFB already have notes** and don't need to stay empty placeholders.

2. **Tutorial ↔ Razavi mapping is only partly right in CLAUDE.md §3.4.** I checked it against the book:
   - Tut 2 = Razavi **9.1, 9.2, 9.3** ✅ (noise sub-parts removed)
   - Tut 3 = Razavi **9.4, 9.6, 9.8** ✅ (noise sub-part removed)
   - Tut 4 Q1 is an **adapted 9.10**: different µnCox (172.35) and λ, and an extra part (b) with ideal sources. **Q2 and Q3 are not Razavi problems** (gain-boosting design).
   - Tut 5 Q1 is **9.11 extended** with parts (b) and (c); Q2 = **9.12** ✅; **Q3 is not Razavi** (CMFB with R = 10 MΩ).
   - Tut 6 (slew rate, 3 questions) is **not Razavi**.
   - **Tut 1 is Sedra–Smith style** (k′n, |V′A|, Q1…Q4 naming), not Razavi.

3. **The exam question is Quiz 1 Part C.** The exam paper (now recovered) and the Quiz 1 key both give (W/L)5,6 = **30**, so the cut-off-scan flag in §11 is resolved.

4. **Buffer bandwidth, three accepted answers.** For Exam Q1(e) the key gives **31.95 MHz** from 1/(2πCL(1/gm2 ‖ rO4)) and **32.19 MHz** from f3dB·(1 + βA). The conversation's 1/gm gives **31.8 MHz**. The app will teach 1/gm as the fast route and accept all three, explaining the difference.

5. **Ex 9.7 gain.** The exact square law gives **1429**, Razavi prints **1416**, your notes say **1408** and the conversation says "≈ 1.4 × 10³". They agree to 1%. The app shows 1429 and cites the book's value.

6. **Quiz 2 key rounds intermediates** (VP = 0.11 V instead of 0.1106 V, and so on), so its W/L answers differ from exact arithmetic by up to 1.3%. The engine gives exact values, and the practice checker's ±2% tolerance accepts either.

7. **Part 1 WE2 statement was lost.** Only its answers survive (W/L 22.2, VG 0.5 V, RD 9 kΩ). I rebuilt the givens that reproduce them: VDD 1.8 V, ID 100 µA, Vov 0.15 V, Vth 0.35 V, µnCox 400 µA/V², VD = 0.9 V. Please confirm or send the original.

8. **Tutorial 2 Q2(b), a real disagreement with your preliminary values.** You had output 0.70–1.50 V. That range is right for the cascode stacks alone. But in Fig. 9.9, **M2's gate is tied to Vout**, so M2 leaves saturation above Vb − VGS4 + Vth2 = **1.21 V**. The true range is **0.70–1.21 V** (a 0.507 V window, Vth − Vov4, the Ex 9.5 result). See §7.

9. **Tutorial 2 Q1(c) is ambiguous.** "Gain at the peaks of the output swing" depends on whether you average the two halves (one PMOS in triode, the other still saturated, giving **19.8**) or quote the triode half alone (**15.2**). Nominal is 24.4. The engine reports both; please ask your instructor which one they want.

10. **Notation clash: Sedra vs Razavi.** Tutorial 1 uses k′n(W/L), |V′A| and Vt, while your notes use µnCox(W/L), λ and Vth. The app uses your notes' symbols (§6) and shows a one-line translation on Tutorial 1 problems (k′n = µnCox, VA = 1/λ = |V′A|·L).

11. **Problem Set 1 P5 (from our chat) has a hidden triode device.** With (W/L)5–8 = 100/0.5 in Set A, each PMOS diode costs |VGS| = 1.161 V, so the diode stack puts M3's drain at 3 − 2(1.161) = 0.678 V, *below* M3's source VX = 0.707 V: M3 is in triode, not saturation. The chat's key (VX 0.707 V, Vout 0.900–1.478 V) assumes every device is saturated. The formulas and numbers are right *given* that assumption, but the circuit as sized can't hold it: the PMOS need W/L ≥ 417 (|Vov| ≤ 0.25 V). This is exactly the trap Tutorial 2 Q2(a) asks about. The app keeps the key's numbers, shows M3 red in the figure, and explains why.

## 3. Inventory by unit

Format for each unit: **concepts · formulas · worked examples (verified numbers) · analogies · diagrams to build · check questions**. Every formula listed here already exists in `src/physics/`.

### U0 Circuit language
- **Concepts:** voltage is height and current is flow; ground is sea level; a node voltage is "supply minus the drops"; series/parallel; "smallest resistance in parallel wins"; voltage divider; current divider (cross-over rule).
- **Formulas:** V = IR · R1‖R2 · V·R2/(R1+R2) · IA = I·RB/(RA+RB)
- **Examples:** 0.1 mA through 10 kΩ drops 1 V (Conv M1); 1 MΩ ‖ 20 kΩ ≈ 19.6 kΩ; the current divider in folded-cascode Gm (P7: 91.1%).
- **Analogies:** water height / flow / narrow pipe / sea level.
- **Diagrams:** water-tank analogy; resistor divider; current divider with arrows sized by current.
- **Checks:** walk the node voltages of a two-resistor stack; which branch takes more current.

### U1 The MOSFET  ·  U2 Triode / saturation
- **Concepts:** gate = capacitor plate on glass, so gate current is 0; channel forms at Vth; Vov = VGS − Vth is channel thickness; W/L is tap size; the channel is thinner at the drain end (Vov − VDS); pinch-off at VDS = Vov; waterfall; λ ∝ 1/L.
- **Formulas:** triode ID = µCox(W/L)[Vov·VDS − VDS²/2]; saturation ID = ½µCox(W/L)Vov²(1 + λVDS); deep-triode Ron = 1/(µCox(W/L)Vov); fence VD ≥ VG − Vth.
- **Analogies:** tap and handle; waterfall (flow set upstream, not by the height of the drop); "overdrive is rent paid in volts".
- **Diagrams:** cross-section with a channel that thins as VDS rises (three panels); ID–VDS family with the knee at VDS = Vov and a live operating point.
- **Checks:** audit Q1 (why ID stops growing); why λ ∝ 1/L; forgotten ½ (mistake catalogue).

### U3 DC recipe and PMOS
- **Concepts:** assume saturation → square law → walk the nodes → **check the fence** (skipping the check costs marks); analysis direction (W/L → Vov) vs design direction (Vov → W/L); PMOS with magnitudes, |VGS| = VS − VG; the "five numbers per device" (ID, Vov, W/L, gm, rO), where any two fix the rest.
- **Examples (verified):**
  - **WE1** VDD 1.8, VG 0.7, Vth 0.4, µnCox 200µ, W/L 10, RD 10k, λ 0.1 → Vov 0.3, ID 90 µA, VD 0.9 V, saturated ✓
  - **WE2** (design, givens reconstructed, see flag 7) → W/L 22.2, VG 0.5 V, RD 9 kΩ
  - **WE3** PMOS, VS 1.8, VG 0.9, |Vth| 0.5, µpCox 100µ, W/L 20, RD 5k → |Vov| 0.4, ID 160 µA, VD 0.8 V ✓
  - **Tut 1 Q1** (bias design with a mirror): RD 9k, W/L 22.22 / 44.44 / 22.22, R 13 kΩ
  - **Current-mirror handout problem:** cascode mirror, Vp,min = 2Vov + Vth = 0.6 V → Vov 0.11 V, W/L 22.04
- **Diagrams:** "node-voltage walk" stepper (each node labelled as it is solved); fence check in green or red.

### U4 Small signal
- **Concepts:** linearise at Q (tangent); DC voltage sources → AC ground; DC current sources → open; transistor → gm·vgs ‖ rO; gm·rO is independent of ID ("you can't buy gain with current").
- **Formulas:** gm = µCox(W/L)Vov = √(2µCox(W/L)ID) = 2ID/Vov (a table of when to use each form); rO = 1/(λID) = VA/ID, VA = |V′A|·L; gm·rO = 2/(λVov); gm·rO ∝ √(WL/ID).
- **Examples:** WE1 gm 0.6 mA/V, rO 111.1 kΩ, gm·rO 66.7; Tut 1 Q3 rO = 3.6 V/100 µA = 36 kΩ.
- **Checks:** audit Q2, Q3; "if ID is still in your gain formula, you probably made an error".

### U5 Common source
- **Concepts:** transfer curve (off → saturated → triode); gain = slope at Q; inverts; Av = −Gm·Rout.
- **Formulas:** Av = −gm(RD‖rO); |Av| = 2·Vdrop/Vov.
- **Examples:** WE1 → Av −5.50 (−6 without rO); a gain of 10 at Vov 0.2 needs a 1 V drop, impossible on a 1 V supply.
- **Diagrams:** transfer curve with a draggable Q and its tangent; small-signal model side by side.

### U6 Impedance rules, current sources, diodes, mirrors
- **Concepts:** into the gate ∞; into the drain rO, or rO + (1 + gm rO)RS ≈ gm rO RS; into the source 1/gm (+ RD/(gm rO)), → ∞ with an ideal current-source drain load; "up multiplies, down divides — by gm·rO"; a current source costs |Vov| and looks like rO; a diode costs |VGS| and looks like 1/gm; mirror ratio = (W/L) ratio; cascode mirror; low-voltage cascode mirror and its Vb generation (handout).
- **Examples:** push-current derivations (Conv Part 2); cascode mirror Vp,min = 2Vov + Vth.
- **Analogies:** "the transistor fights back" (impedance explorer animation); "bodyguard" (cascode shielding).
- **Diagrams:** three-terminal impedance card; diode-connected device; basic, cascode and low-voltage cascode mirrors (handout Figs 1–10).
- **Checks:** audit Q8, Q9, Q14.

### U7 CS with every load, and degeneration
- **Formulas:** resistor −gm(rO‖RD); diode −gm1/gm2 = −√(µn(W/L)1/µp(W/L)2); current source −gm1(rO1‖rO2); triode −gm1·Ron2 with Ron2 = 1/(µpCox(W/L)2(VDD − Vb − |Vthp|)); active −(gm1 + gm2)(rO1‖rO2); degenerated −RD/(1/gm + RS), Rout = rO + (1 + gm rO)RS.
- **Ratio rule:** |Av| = (R at the output terminal) ÷ (R in the source path, where the transistor counts as 1/gm).
- **Examples:** WE9 gm 1 mA/V, RD 10k, RS 1k → 10 becomes 5; the "circuit you've never seen" (current source + diode load) → Rout 3.85 kΩ, Av −3.85.
- **Trade-off table:** triode (headroom-efficient but process-fragile) vs active (gain-efficient but bias-fragile).

### U8 Source follower and common gate
- **Formulas:** follower Av = RS′/(1/gm + RS′) < 1, Rout = 1/gm ‖ rO; CG Av = +gm RD, Rin = (RD + rO)/(1 + gm rO).
- **Concepts:** the follower is an inefficient driver (0.5 when 1/gm = RL); CG gives a low Rin only if its load is small; no Miller effect in CG.
- **Note:** γ = 0 by default (the tutorials say so); gmb appears only where the source moves, and is introduced only if a lesson needs it.

### U9 Cascode
- **Formulas:** Rout ≈ gm2 rO2 rO1; Av ≈ −(gm rO)²; telescopic Rout = (gm rO²)‖(gm rO²) → Av ≈ (gm rO)²/2.
- **Example (WE12, all gm = 1 mA/V, rO = 20k):** CS + source load 10; cascode + simple load 19; cascode + cascode load 220; ideal load 440.
- **The load trap:** a simple load wins the parallel combination (mistake catalogue).
- **Diagrams:** shielding (node X barely moves); an Rout bar chart comparing the loads.

### U10 Differential pair
- **Concepts:** VCM = (V1 + V2)/2, vd = V1 − V2; tail = fixed pie; full steering at ±√2·Vov; P is a virtual ground for DM only; half circuit; CM half circuit with 2RSS; CMRR.
- **Formulas:** ID1 − ID2 = ½µCox(W/L)ΔVin√(4ISS/(µCox W/L) − ΔVin²); gm at balance √(µCox(W/L)ISS); Ad = −gm(RD‖rO); ACM = −RD/(1/gm + 2RSS); CMRR ≈ (1 + 2gm RSS)gm/Δgm; Vin,CM,min = VISS + VGS1, Vin,CM,max = VD1 + Vth1.
- **Examples (verified):** Tut 1 Q1 CMIR −0.25…+0.35 V; Q2 W1,2/W3,4 = 25; Q3 W/L 12.5/50, Ad 18; Q4 VCM 2.33, RD 5.06k, VD 2.47, ACM −1.92, ΔVCM 0.29.
- **Analogies:** two kids on a see-saw (the differential output is twice as tall).

### U11 5-T OTA
- **Concepts:** follow the signal currents (+i up M1 → M3, mirrored +i in M4, −i in M2, so 2i reaches the output); Gm = gm1,2; the diode pins X at VDD − |VGS3| (a threshold lost from CMIR); output only pays |Vov4|.
- **Formulas:** Av = gm1,2(rO2‖rO4); Vin,CM ∈ [VISS + VGS1, VDD − |VGS3| + Vth1]; Vout ∈ [VISS + Vov2, VDD − |Vov4|].
- **Examples (verified):** Tut 1 Q5 I = 250 µA; **Exam = Quiz 1 C**: (W/L)3 19.2, (W/L)1 26.67, Av 88.9, Vout 0.35–1.55, f−3dB 358 kHz, buffer 31.8 MHz, SR 30 V/µs; **Quiz 1 A**: W/L 80 and 71.11, Av 133.3, swing 1.35, 636.6 kHz, 85.5 MHz; **Quiz 1 B**: 44.44 and 50, Av 88.9 (key 88.67), 1.2 V, 1.19 MHz, 106.7 MHz; **PS1 P1**: Av 84.3, CM 0.874–1.417, Vout 0.474–1.517, 1.19 MHz, 100.7 MHz.

### U12 Poles and bandwidth
- **Formulas:** ωp = 1/(RC); dominant pole 1/(Rout·CL); GBW = gm/CL (Rout cancels); mirror pole ≈ gm3/CX; Miller C(1 + A).
- **Check:** GBW = gain × f−3dB (88.9 × 358 kHz = 31.8 MHz).

### L1 Performance parameters
- **Formulas:** Aclosed = A/(1 + βA); β = R2/(R1 + R2); ε = 1/(1 + βA) ≈ 1/βA; Amin = Aclosed/ε; ΔAc/Ac = ε·ΔA/A; A(s) = A0/(1 + s/ω0); ωu = A0ω0; τ = 1/[(1 + βA0)ω0] ≈ Aclosed/ωu; t = τ·ln(1/ε) (10% → 2.3τ, 1% → 4.6τ, 0.1% → 6.9τ); SR = ISS/CL; PSRR; swing and noise trade through the load Vov.
- **Examples:** Ex 9.1 A ≥ 990 (exact) / 1000; desensitisation table A = 500/1000/2000 → 9.804/9.901/9.950; Ex 9.2 ωu ≥ 9.21 Grad/s, fu ≥ 1.47 GHz; gm ≥ 9.21 mA/V at CL = 1 pF → ISS ≥ 1.84 mA; Ex 9.3 wrong polarity gives a RHP pole; PS1 P2.
- **Laplace kit (from the settling-example notes):** u(t) ↔ 1/s, e^(−at) ↔ 1/(s + a), partial fractions 1/[s(1 + sτ)] = 1/s − τ/(1 + sτ), factor out (1 + βA0).
- **Analogies:** see-saw op amp; filling a glass while watching the line (feedback); a fixed pocket of coins (GBW); cake eaten by half each minute (settling); a fixed tap filling a bucket (slewing); a room with a ceiling and floor (headroom); a bathroom scale reading 0.5 kg with nobody on it (offset); drawing on a bumpy bus (supply rejection).
- **Tutorial 6** (slewing + linear settling) belongs here and to L9.

### L2 One-stage op amps
- **Formulas:** fully differential swing 2(VDD − |Vov3| − Vov1 − VISS); telescopic Av = gm1[gm3rO3rO1 ‖ gm5rO5rO7] ≈ (gm rO)²/2; swing 2[VDD − (Vov1 + Vov3 + VISS + |Vov5| + |Vov7|)]; mirror-loaded swing loses |Vthp|; three bias conditions; buffer Rout → 1/gm, pole → gm/CL; buffer window Vb1 − Vth4 ≤ Vout ≤ Vb1 − VGS4 + Vth2 (width Vth − Vov4); Ex 9.6 VCM choice; the saturation-algebra trick (the source voltage cancels).
- **Examples:** VDD 1.0 / Vth 0.3 / Vov 0.1 numbers; Ex 9.4 gm 1 mS, rO 20k → Rout 10k → 910 Ω; ε = 17% at Aopen = 5; telescopic vs OTA swing at 1.2 V (0.8 vs 1.4 Vpp); window 0.25 V at Vth 0.4 / Vov 0.15; PS1 P3–P5.

### L3 Design procedure
- Ex 9.7 walk-through (flag 5); gm·rO ∝ √(WL/ID); lengthen off-signal-path devices; bias voltages at the saturation edges (1.4 / 1.6 / 1.7 V); Vb1 tracking VGS,b1 = Vov1,2 + VGS3,4 (Eq. 9.16), so Mb1 is narrow and long; linear scaling (Ex 9.8, PS1 P9).

### L4 Folded cascode
- Folding; ISS1 = ISS/2 + I1; the input-CM inequality flips (telescopic caps it from above, folded holds it from below); Rup = gm5rO5rO7, Rdown = gm3rO3(rO1‖rO9); Gm by current divider (≈ gm1); swing VDD − 4 overdrives (no VISS); folding-node pole; NMOS-input version; CMIR both versions (Lec 06: Vin,CM,max = VDD − |Vov11| − |VGS1|, Vin,CM,min = Vov9 − |Vthp|); comparison table; PS1 P6–P10.

### L5 Two-stage (Lec 07) · L6 Gain boosting (Lec 06–09) · L7–L8 CMFB (Lec 09–12)
- **Two-stage:** A1 = gm1,2(rO1,2‖rO3,4), A2 = gm5,6(rO5,6‖rO7,8), A = A1A2; a cascode first stage with a CS second stage.
- **Gain boosting:** Iout/Vin = A1gm/(RS + (1 + A1)gm rO RS); Rout = RS + rO + (1 + A1)gm RS rO; cascode version Rout ≈ (1 + A1)gm2rO2rO1 → (gm rO)³; with the aux as a CS device M3, A1 = gm3rO3 (or gm3gm4rO4rO3 when cascoded); Vout,min = VGS3 + Vov2 (the disadvantage); M3 saturation needs VGS2 ≤ |Vth3|; differential and folded-cascode aux amps.
- **CMFB:** outputs of two current sources in series float; resistive sensing (R1 = R2 gives Vout,CM; gain drops to gm(rO‖rO‖R1)); source-follower sensing; triode sensing (Rtot = 1/(µCox(W/L)(Vout1 + Vout2 − 2Vth))); the loop Vb1 − VGS3 = 2ID·Rtot,P gives Vout1 + Vout2; mirror implementations and error removal (Lec 12).
- **Quiz 2** (verified): Part A VD4 1.16, VP 0.11, W/L11,12 3.62 (key 3.63), Vout,min 0.29, Rout,down 55.9 MΩ (key 55.63); Parts B and C likewise.
