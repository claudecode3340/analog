# Analog Gym

An offline, interactive tutor for Razavi's op-amp chapter (EEE/INSTR F313), built from `CLAUDE.md`.

## Use it

- **One file, anywhere:** `npm run build:single` → open `dist-single/index.html` in any browser (works offline, on a phone too).
- **Develop:** `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.

Progress lives in your browser. Export or import it from **Settings**.

## Checks

| Command | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Physics unit tests, the full CLAUDE.md §11 regression table, Quiz 1/2 keys, Tutorials 2–3, generators (300 seeds each, two independent solves), answer checker, content lint |
| `npm run shots` | Playwright: every figure at 1280 px and 390 px in light and dark mode, with automatic label-overlap detection; a smoke test of every lesson and page; the offline single-file build |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript |
