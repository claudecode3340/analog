    idea: `A cascode gives gain but eats swing. A **two-stage** op amp splits the jobs: the **first stage** (a differential pair, maybe cascoded) makes the gain; the **second stage** (a common-source device with a current-source load) makes the swing, because its output has only one transistor at each rail.

The gains multiply: $A = A_1 A_2$. The first stage’s output CM level (X, Y) is not free: it is the gate of the second stage, so it must sit where M5 carries its current: $V_X = V_{DD} - |V_{GS5}|$. That also caps the input CM at $V_X + V_{th}$.

The price: two high-resistance nodes, two poles — compensation (L13–L14).`,

    idea: `In a cascode, M2 fights changes in its current because its source X is loaded by rO1. With **gain boosting** an auxiliary amplifier watches X and drives M2’s gate the opposite way: if X rises, M2’s gate falls by A1 times as much. M2 fights back (1 + A1) times harder:

$R_{out} = r_{O1} + r_{O2} + (1 + A_1)\\,g_{m2}r_{O2}r_{O1}$.

With a single-transistor auxiliary (a CS stage, $A_1 = g_{m3}r_{O3}$) Rout reaches about $(g_m r_O)^3/r$-level values. The cost: headroom ($V_{out,min} = V_{GS3} + V_{ov2}$) and a doublet in the frequency response. And the load must be boosted too — the load trap again.`,

**Common-mode feedback (CMFB)** fixes it: **sense** $V_{out,CM} = (V_{out1} + V_{out2})/2$, **compare** it with a reference, and **adjust** one of the current sources.

Sensing options: two resistors R1 = R2 (simple, but they load the output: gain drops to $g_m(r_O\\parallel r_O\\parallel R)$), source followers, or **deep-triode devices** in the tail whose resistance depends on $V_{out1} + V_{out2}$.`,

Anything that fixes $V_P$ (for example a cascode bias: $V_P = V_{b1} - V_{GS}$) therefore fixes the output CM. In practice an **error amplifier** compares $V_{out,CM}$ with $V_{REF}$ and drives a current source (Tutorial 5 Q2, Lec 12): the **CMFB loop gain** is error-amp gain × how strongly that current source moves the output CM.

Critical step: slewing starts when $V_0 A_{CL}/\\tau > SR$.
