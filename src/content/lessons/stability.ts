**Dominant-pole compensation**: leave the fast poles alone and slide the first pole {{omegap1}} down (add capacitance at that node). Near ωgx the dominant pole’s phase is already ≈ −90°, so sliding it changes the gain, not the dangerous phase.

Hand method: the other poles may use only 90° − PM at ωgx. For one other pole: $\\omega_{gx} = \\omega_{p2}\\tan(90^\\circ - PM)$ (at 45°, ωgx = ωp2). Then $\\omega'_{p1} = \\omega_{gx}/(\\beta A_0)$. Cost: bandwidth. With β < 1 you may compensate 1/β less (Ex 10.5).`,
